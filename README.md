### Conclusion
- For the selection of the model types we have created, namely s and x, the s type has a faster training process compared to the x type, but for the mAP50 result, the x type performs better.

- As for the version selection, v5 has a quicker training process compared to v8, but for the mAP50 result, v8 provides better performance.
